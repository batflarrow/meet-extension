# Meet-Extension
## Chrome Extension for Google Meet to add the a few missing functionalities
Currently Implemented Functionalities
1. Push To Talk
2. Mute Individual Meet
3. Mute Microphone of google meet from any window (whether chrome window is in focus or not) using Ctrl+Shift+5.
(Since this is a global shortcut, it can't be just anything we want to minimize the risk of overriding shortcuts in other applications).
